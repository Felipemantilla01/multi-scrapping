text-decoration:underline\">[2]</a><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'> \u00a0Throughout these last months, I have been inspired by the MRAC and subcommittee members\u2019 continuous engagement in their various work streams amid the ongoing pandemic, the trickle-down impacts of regulatory and administrative change, and perhaps the most unpredictable of all, shifting policies, practices, and procedures on the individual \u201chome-slash-work\u201d front.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif'><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Carving out the time and space to focus on issues like interest rate benchmark reform, clearinghouse risk management, market structure, and the overarching impact of climate change on our financial markets\u2014issues our members have dedicated themselves to for the better part of my 3+ year tenure as the MRAC sponsor\u2014may actually serve as a comfortable respite. \u00a0However, adding on the various external stresses and the need to comprehend and incorporate new variables has certainly augmented the experience of addressing market structural concerns as we flex forward into 2021.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif'><span lang=\"EN\" style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif' xml:lang=\"EN\">Indeed, as we have already witnessed these last few months, with so many inputs, new market entrants, and means of intermediation</span><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>\u2014</span><span lang=\"EN\" style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif' xml:lang=\"EN\">or the absence thereof, our markets as a system are fragile in the sense that they are programmatically susceptible to what seem like implausible reactions to increasingly diverse externalities.\u00a0 With structural concerns across the financial markets making headlines, the Commission has remained ever vigilant in carrying out its mission and mandate, and will absolutely continue to do so under my leadership.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif'><span lang=\"EN\" style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif' xml:lang=\"EN\">Regarding the most recent events in the precious metals and energy markets, I am personally, along with dedicated staff throughout the agency, communicating with fellow regulators, exchanges, and stakeholders to address any potential threats to the integrity of the derivatives markets, evaluating in real-time structural and transparency concerns.\u00a0 We at the CFTC continue to employ heightened alertness in surveilling these markets for fraud and manipulation.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif'><span lang=\"EN\" style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif' xml:lang=\"EN\">Moreover, it can never be repeated too often: derivatives markets play a critical role in the everyday lives of all Americans.\u00a0 This is especially true when it comes to the production and supply of reliable and low-cost energy.\u00a0 At a time of many challenges across the country resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, last week\u2019s extreme weather events in Texas and surrounding states created unimaginable burdens for millions of Americans.\u00a0 Though perhaps not at the forefront of everyone\u2019s thoughts when nearly half of Texas\u2019 residents remain without drinkable water, and thousands remain without electricity, this Arctic blast highlighted weaknesses in our energy infrastructure that will likely be challenged and stressed more often in the future as a result of more frequent extreme weather events.\u00a0 As we collectively act to restore normalcy and stability in our lives and to reignite economic and employment productivity and growth, I commit to taking any and all actions to ensure the CFTC contributes to this administration\u2019s efforts by ensuring our markets remain transparent, fair and efficient, and fulfill their core responsibilities of price discovery and risk management to ensure reliable and low-cost energy for all Americans.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:16px;

margin-bottom:16px\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif'><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Today\u2019s meeting is an ambitious endeavor to hear from all four of the MRAC subcommittees and hold our first ever panel focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion in the derivatives industry and related markets.\u00a0 First, Tom Wipf, the Chairman of the MRAC\u2019s Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Subcommittee (Benchmark Subcommittee) and also Chairman of the Alternative Reference </span><span lang=\"EN\" style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif' xml:lang=\"EN\">Rate Committee (ARRC) of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) will provide an update on the transition away from LIBOR (London Inter-Bank Offered Rate). </span>\u00a0<span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>This subcommittee demonstrated exceptional effectiveness through 2020, perhaps most notably for leading the June 2<sup>nd</sup> table-top exercise as a prelude to the PAI/discounting switch for LIBOR swaps by the clearing houses.</span><a href=\"#_ftn3\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\">[3]</a><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'> \u00a0The robust discussions provided the central counterparties (CCPs) valuable feedback on their proposed approaches, raised awareness among market participants and vendors, and from the CFTC\u2019s perspective, helped highlight critical areas where regulatory relief would mitigate potential risks associated with the event.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif'><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Another milestone the market achieved was the successful launch of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol</span><a href=\"#_ftn4\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\">[4]</a><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'> to introduce robust fallback language for interest rate swaps. \u00a0The Protocol became effective on January 25, 2021. \u00a0The relevant CCPs simultaneously adopted the fallback language in their respective rule books for cleared swaps.</span><a href=\"#_ftn5\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\">[5]</a><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'> \u00a0CME is in the process of adopting appropriate fallback language into its rulebook for Eurodollar futures and options, which settle to the 3-month USD LIBOR.</span><a href=\"#_ftn6\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\">[6]</a><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'> \u00a0Based on CFTC staff analysis of information from ISDA and data from swap data repositories (SDRs), legal entities that account for close to 95% of gross notional outstanding\u2014cleared + uncleared\u2014in interest rate swaps (IRS) have adhered to the Protocol. \u00a0Digging deeper, 69% of notional outstanding of uncleared IRS now have the updated ISDA fallback language.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif'><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>There is a long tail of end-users with a small footprint in the swaps markets. \u00a0Our expectation is that many of them will either close their swap positions or negotiate appropriate fallback language bilaterally with their counterparties. \u00a0But not having a plan just because the firm has 1-2 open swaps is not an option. \u00a0To the extent there are large, active firms who have not yet adhered to the Protocol, relevant regulators and counterparties will be apt to take notice.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif'><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Authorities have been highlighting the lack of robust fallback language in swaps contracts as a financial stability risk factor, for good reason. We want to make sure that robust contractual language is in place in case of a cessation of the reference rate.\u00a0 There is much anticipation that cessation announcements by ICE Benchmark Administration and the UK Financial Conduct Authority will be made in the near future, and these will definitively put the end-game for USD LIBOR and other IBORs in sight. \u00a0For all practical purposes, the markets will most likely be shifting from USD LIBOR to SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) and other alternate reference rates in the coming months.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif'><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>I am looking forward to hearing from the Benchmark Subcommitee on how the markets, especially the derivative markets, will shed the USD LIBOR habit. \u00a0Thanks to the close collaborative partnership with the ARRC and the MRAC subcommittee, CFTC has been at the forefront in terms of providing appropriate regulatory relief to facilitate this transition. We remain committed to supporting this effort.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif'><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Second, Bob Litterman, Chairman of the Climate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee (the Climate Subcommittee) will present on the Subcommittee\u2019s September release of its report on Managing Climate Risk in the U.S. Financial System (the Climate Report).</span><a href=\"#_ftn7\" style=\"color:blue;

Leading the men and women of the CFTC these last 17 months has been an extraordinary privilege but, like all good things, it must come to an end. Today, I am announcing that I intend to resign my position as Chairman early next year.</p><p></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I am immensely proud of the agency\u2019s accomplishments in our pursuit to be the global standard for sound derivatives regulation. During my tenure, we have held 20 open meetings, more than the previous 7 years combined; we have vigorously protected the integrity of our markets and set numerous enforcement records; we have successfully concluded negotiations with the EU and UK to build stronger relationships with our regulatory counterparts overseas; we have promoted responsible fintech innovation and declared Ether a commodity; we have seen more than 1,000 new products self-certified to trade on our markets; we have taken strides to deliver more value for taxpayers and be an even better place for our employees to work; we have enhanced our agency\u2019s diversity, with more women and people of color serving in senior leadership roles than ever before; and so much more. We have done all of this with the interests of everyday Americans in mind\u2014including our nation\u2019s farmers and ranchers who rely on derivatives to hedge their risk. With the agenda I laid out last year now complete, the Commission can fully turn its focus to the unwritten future. </p><p></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A majority of our work has taken place in the midst of COVID-19\u2014a global pandemic that is testing the strength of our markets and our ability to adapt. Amid historic volatility, the CFTC has provided a steady hand and watchful eye while our markets act as shock absorbers. There is no doubt in my mind this has been the CFTC\u2019s \u201cfinest hour\u201d during our celebrated 45-year history.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p><p></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Of course, none of these achievements would have been possible without the hard work of the CFTC\u2019s dedicated career public servants, our Executive Leadership Team, and my personal staff within the Office of the Chairman.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>I also owe a deep debt of gratitude to my fellow Commissioners, who I am proud to call not just colleagues, but also friends. Together we have advanced 40 final rules and 21 proposals\u2014nearly 90 percent of them on a bipartisan basis. The partisan divisions in Washington may run deep, but the Commission\u2019s historically collegial atmosphere has continued uninterrupted.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span></p><p></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I am truly grateful to our President and his Administration for their confidence and the opportunity to serve.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>I am also humbled by the broad, bipartisan support of my leadership and agenda across both houses of Congress during my tenure. Finally, I am most deeply appreciative for my wife and two young boys, who have supported me\u2014and my long hours\u2014every step of the way.</p><p></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;\nline-height:107%;font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'><p></p></span></p>\n</div>\n      \n          <p align=\"center\"><b>-CFTC-</b></p><p>\n      </p></div>\n\n</article>"},

style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Overview <p></p></span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>I am pleased to support the two final rulemakings that the Commission is adopting with respect to margin requirements for uncleared swaps.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>These rulemakings address several recommendations that the Commission received from its Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC), which I am proud to sponsor, and are based on a comprehensive report prepared by GMAC\u2019s Subcommittee on Margin Requirements for Non-Cleared Swaps (GMAC Margin Subcommittee).<a name=\"_ftnref1\" id=\"_ftnref1\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn1\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:\n_ftnref1\">[1]</span></a><span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>They demonstrate the value added to the Commission\u2019s policymaking by its Advisory Committees, in which market participants and other interested parties come together to provide us with their perspectives and potential solutions to practical problems. <p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>The two rulemakings we are adopting make 4 changes to the Commission\u2019s uncleared margin rules.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>The four changes have much to commend them \u2013 indeed, we did not receive any comment letters opposing them.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>These rule changes further objectives that I have commented on before:</span></p>\n\n<ul><li class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>the need to tailor our rules to assure that they are workable for those required to comply with them;</span></li>\n\t<li class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"text-indent: -0.25in; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">the benefits of codifying relief that has been issued by our Staff and re-visiting our rules, where appropriate; and</span></li>\n\t<li class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>the imperative of harmonizing our margin requirements with those of our international colleagues in order to facilitate compliance and coordinated regulatory oversight.\u00a0<p></p></span></li>\n</ul><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>A Different Universe is Coming into Scope of the Uncleared Margin Rules<p></p></span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>The Commission\u2019s uncleared margin rules for swap dealers, like the Framework of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Board of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (BCBS/IOSCO) on which they are based,<a name=\"_ftnref2\" id=\"_ftnref2\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn2\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref2\">[2]</span></a> were designed primarily to ensure the exchange of margin between the largest, most systemic, and interconnected financial institutions for their uncleared swap transactions with one another.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Today, these institutions and transactions are subject to uncleared margin requirements that have taken effect since the rules were adopted.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Pursuant to the phased implementation schedule of the Commission\u2019s rules and the BCBS/IOSCO Framework, though, a different universe of market participants \u2013 presenting unique considerations \u2013 will soon be coming into scope of the margin rules.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>It is only now, as we enter the final phases of the implementation schedule, that the Commission\u2019s uncleared margin rules will apply to a significant number of financial end-users, and we have a responsibility to make sure they are fit for that purpose.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Accordingly, now is the time we must thoughtfully consider whether the regulatory parameters that we have designed for the largest financial institutions in the earlier phases of margin implementation need to be tailored to account for the practical and operational challenges posed by the exchange of margin when one of the counterparties is a pension plan, endowment, insurance provider, mortgage service provider, or other financial end-user.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>The rulemaking regarding the \u201cminimum transfer amount\u201d does exactly that.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>The Commission\u2019s uncleared margin rules provide that a swap dealer is not required to collect or post initial margin (IM) or variation margin (VM) with a counterparty until the combined amount of such IM and VM exceeds the minimum transfer amount (MTA) of $500,000.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Yet, the application of the MTA presents a significant operational challenge for institutional investors that typically hire asset managers to exercise investment discretion over portions of their assets in separately managed accounts (SMAs) for purposes of diversification.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>As a practical matter, neither the owner of the SMA, the manager of the assets in the SMA, nor the swap dealer that is a counterparty to the SMA is in a position to readily determine when the MTA has been exceeded on an aggregate basis (or to assure that it is not).<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span><p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>To address this challenge, the Commission is amending the definition of MTA in its margin rules to allow a swap dealer to apply an MTA of up to $50,000 to each SMA owned by a counterparty with which the swap dealer enters into uncleared swaps.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>As noted in the release, any potential increase in uncollateralized credit risk as a result would be mitigated both by the conditions set out in the rules we are adopting, as well as existing safeguards in the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and the Commission\u2019s regulations.<a name=\"_ftnref3\" id=\"_ftnref3\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn3\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:\n_ftnref3\">[3]</span></a><p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>This is a sensible approach and an appropriate refinement to make the Commission\u2019s uncleared margin rules workable for SMAs given the realities of the modern investment management environment.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>As I have stated before, no matter how well-intentioned a rule may be, if it is not workable, it cannot deliver on its intended purpose.<a name=\"_ftnref4\" id=\"_ftnref4\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn4\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref4\">[4]</span></a><span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span><p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>The Benefits of Codifying Staff Relief and Re-Visiting our Rules <p></p></span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Application of MTA to SMAs</span></i></b><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>:<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>The rule change that I have discussed above regarding the application of the MTA to SMAs would codify no-action relief in Letter No. 17-12 that our Staff issued in 2017.<a name=\"_ftnref5\" id=\"_ftnref5\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn5\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref5\">[5]</span></a><span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>The Commission\u2019s Staff often has occasion to issue relief or take other action in the form of no-action letters, interpretative letters, or advisories on various issues and in various circumstances.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>This affords the Commission a chance to observe how the Staff action operates in real-time, and to evaluate lessons learned.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>With the benefit of this time and experience, the Commission should then consider whether codifying such Staff action into rules is appropriate.<a name=\"_ftnref6\" id=\"_ftnref6\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn6\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref6\">[6]</span></a><span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span><p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>As I have said before, \u201c[i]t is simply good government to re-visit our rules and assess whether certain rules need to be updated, evaluate whether rules are achieving their objectives, and identify rules that are falling short and should be withdrawn or improved.\u201d<a name=\"_ftnref7\" id=\"_ftnref7\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn7\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref7\">[7]</span></a><span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Experience with the Staff no-action relief in Letter No. 17-12 supports our rule change to tailor the application of the MTA under the Commission\u2019s uncleared margin rules in the SMA context.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span><p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Two of the other rule changes that we are adopting similarly would codify existing Staff no-action relief in recognition of market realities:<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Separate MTAs for IM and VM</span></i></b><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>:<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Our second rule change regarding the MTA, consistent with Staff no-action Letter No. 19-25,<a name=\"_ftnref8\" id=\"_ftnref8\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn8\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref8\">[8]</span></a> would recognize that a swap dealer may apply separate MTAs for IM and VM with each counterparty, provided that the MTAs corresponding to IM and VM are specified in the margin documentation required under the Commission\u2019s regulations, and that the MTAs, on a combined basis, do not exceed the prescribed MTA.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span><p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Staff\u2019s no-action relief, and the Commission\u2019s rule amendments to codify that relief, take into account the separate settlement workflows that swap counterparties maintain to reflect, from an operational perspective, the different regulatory treatment of IM and VM.<a name=\"_ftnref9\" id=\"_ftnref9\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn9\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref9\">[9]</span></a><span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>And given that the total amount of combined IM and VM exchanged would not exceed the prescribed MTA, separate MTAs for IM and VM would not materially increase the amount of credit risk at a given time.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Under Letter No. 19-25 and this codification, swap dealers and their counterparties can manage MTA in an operationally practicable way that aligns with the market standard.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span><p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Reliance on Counterparty\u2019s Model Calculation of IM</span></i></b><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>:<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>A third rule change we are adopting codifies a Staff no-action position taken in Letter No. 19-29,<a name=\"_ftnref10\" id=\"_ftnref10\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn10\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref10\">[10]</span></a> providing that a swap dealer may use the risk-based model calculation of IM of a counterparty that is a CFTC-registered swap dealer as the amount of IM that the former must collect from the latter.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>The release states the Commission\u2019s expectation that this alternative method of IM collection will be used by swap dealers with a discrete and limited swap business consisting primarily of entering into uncleared customer-facing swaps with end-user counterparties, and then hedging the risk of those swaps with uncleared swaps entered into with a few other swap dealers.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span><p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Simply put, not all swap dealers are created equal.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>It is therefore appropriate to tailor our uncleared margin regime accordingly.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Letter No. 19-29 recognized this reality and smoothed the rough edges of our otherwise one-size-fits-all uncleared margin rules, and it is appropriate to codify that result.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Yet, under the rule amendments being adopted, this alternative method is subject to the condition that the uncleared swaps for which a swap dealer uses the risk-based model calculation of IM of its swap dealer counterparty are entered into for the purpose of hedging the former\u2019s own risk from entering into customer-facing swaps with non-swap dealer counterparties.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>This is a departure from the GMAC Margin Subcommittee, which did not recommend such a condition.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>I am concerned by comments we received suggesting that this condition may cause this rule change to prove unworkable in practice.<a name=\"_ftnref11\" id=\"_ftnref11\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn11\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref11\">[11]</span></a><span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>I am encouraged that the rulemaking release addresses some of these comments by, among other things, confirming: 1) the flexibility of swap dealers as part of their hedging strategy to match a set of customer-facing swaps with one or more hedging swaps undertaken with other swap dealer counterparties; and 2) that customer-facing swaps entered into through anticipatory hedging or that are subsequently terminated would be deemed hedges for purposes of the alternative method of IM calculation.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Nevertheless, if over time, market participants find that the hedging condition causes this rule change to fail to fulfill its intended purpose, I urge them to alert the Commission so that it can consider appropriate adjustments.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>International Harmonization to Enhance Compliance and Coordinated Regulation<p></p></span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>The Commission\u2019s fourth and final rule change would revise the calculation method for determining whether financial end-users come within the scope of the IM requirements, and the timing for compliance with the IM requirements after the end of the compliance schedule.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>These changes would align certain timing and calculation issues under the Commission\u2019s margin rules with both the BCBS/IOSCO Framework and the manner in which these issues are handled by our regulatory colleagues in all other major market jurisdictions.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Swap dealers must exchange IM with respect to uncleared swaps that they enter into with a financial end-user counterparty that has \u201cmaterial swaps exposure\u201d (MSE).<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>The Commission\u2019s margin rules currently provide that after the last phase of compliance, MSE is to be determined on <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">January 1</i>, and that an entity has MSE if it has more than $8 billion in average aggregate notional amount (AANA) during <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">June, July, and August </i>of<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\"> the prior year</i>.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>By contrast, under the BCBS/IOSCO Framework and in virtually every other country in the world, an entity is determined to come into scope of the IM requirement on <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">September 1</i>, and an entity has MSE if it has the equivalent of $8 billion in AANA<a name=\"_ftnref12\" id=\"_ftnref12\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn12\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref12\">[12]</span></a> during <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">March, April,</i> and <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">May</i> of <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal\">that year</i>.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>The reason the United States is out-of-step with the rest of the world on these timing and calculation issues is not because of any reasoned policy determination.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Rather, it is the result of a quirk that the U.S. margin rules were adopted based on the BCBS/IOSCO Framework that was in effect at the time \u2013 but the BCBS/IOSCO Framework was revised two years later.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>In a further disconnect, the Commission\u2019s margin rules look to the <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal\">daily average AANA</i> during the three-month calculation period for determining MSE, whereas the BCBS/IOSCO Framework and other major market jurisdictions base the AANA calculation on an <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal\">average of month-end dates </i>during that period.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Yet, as noted in the rulemaking release, the Commission\u2019s Office of the Chief Economist has estimated that calculations based on end-of-month AANA generally would yield similar results as calculations based on the Commission\u2019s current daily AANA approach.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>It has been suggested that this rule change theoretically might incentivize a firm to \u201cwindow dress\u201d its swap exposures as the month-end approaches in order to avoid margin requirements.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>But the GMAC Margin Subcommittee observed that it would be neither practicable nor financially desirable for parties to tear-up their positions on a recurring basis prior to the month-end calculation,<a name=\"_ftnref13\" id=\"_ftnref13\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn13\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:\n_ftnref13\">[13]</span></a> because doing so would interfere with hedging strategies and cause the firm to incur realized profit and loss.<a name=\"_ftnref14\" id=\"_ftnref14\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn14\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref14\">[14]</span></a><p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Accordingly, the Commission is amending these timing and calculation provisions of its uncleared margin rules to harmonize them with the BCBS/IOSCO Framework and the approach followed by our international colleagues.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Given the global nature of the derivatives markets, we should always seek international harmonization of our regulations unless a compelling reason exists not to do so \u2013 which is not the case here.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Indeed, in the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress specifically directed the Commission, \u201c[i]n order to promote effective and consistent global regulation of swaps,\u201d to \u201cconsult and coordinate with foreign regulatory authorities on the establishment of consistent international standards with respect to the regulation . . . of swaps [and] swap entities . . .\u201d<a name=\"_ftnref15\" id=\"_ftnref15\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn15\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref15\">[15]</span></a>\u00a0 And when the G-20 leaders met in Pittsburgh in the midst of the financial crisis in 2009, they, too, recognized that a workable solution for global derivatives markets demands coordinated policies and cooperation.<a name=\"_ftnref16\" id=\"_ftnref16\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn16\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref16\">[16]</span></a><p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Our rule change regarding MSE is true to the direction of Congress in the Dodd-Frank Act, and honors the commitment of the G-20 leaders at the Pittsburgh summit.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Differences between countries in the detailed timing and calculation requirements with respect to uncleared margin compel participants in these global markets to run multiple compliance calculations \u2013 for no particular regulatory reason.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>This not only forces market participants to bear unnecessary costs, but actually hinders compliance with margin requirements because of the entirely foreseeable prospect of calculation errors in applying the different rules.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>As noted above, now is the time to address this disconnect in MSE timing and calculation requirements because the financial end-users to which the MSE definition applies are coming into scope of the margin rules.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>During the unfortunate events of the financial crisis, we learned that coordination among global regulators, working towards a common objective, is essential.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>That lesson remains true today, and we are reminded that disregarding this reality has the potential to weaken, rather than strengthen, the effectiveness of our oversight and the resilience of global derivatives markets.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>There Remains Unfinished Business <p></p></span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>While I am pleased with the steps the Commission is taking, there remains unfinished business in the implementation of uncleared margin requirements.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>As an initial matter, U.S. prudential regulators with oversight authority over bank swap dealers have not yet adopted the corresponding rule changes relevant for consistent applications.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>As a result, although commenters expressed support for the Commission proceeding with these rule changes even in the absence of parallel action by the U.S. prudential regulators, the operational difficulties confronting market participants that are coming into scope of the margin rules will not be fully addressed when they enter into uncleared swaps with bank swap dealers.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>I look forward to continuing the dialogue with our regulatory colleagues at other U.S. agencies to support addressing these challenges.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>In addition, the report of the GMAC Margin Subcommittee recommended several actions, beyond those that we are adopting, to address the hurdles associated with the application of uncleared margin requirements to end-users.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Having been present for the development of the Dodd-Frank Act, I recall that the concerns expressed by many lawmakers at the time focused on the application of the new requirements to end-users.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>The unique challenges with respect to uncleared margin that caused uneasiness back in 2009-2010 are now much more immediate as the margin requirements are being phased in to apply to these end-users.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>As the calendar turns into the new year, I look forward to continuing to work together to address the other recommendations contained in the GMAC Margin Subcommittee\u2019s report regarding applying the uncleared margin rules to financial end-users.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>The need to do so will only become more urgent as time marches on.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"><span

margin rules are not a \u201croll-back\u201d of the margin requirements that apply today to the largest financial institutions in their swap transactions with one another.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Rather, they reflect a thoughtful refinement of our rules to align them with the rest of the international regulatory community, and to take account of specific circumstances in which the rules impose substantial practical and operational challenges (<em>i.e.</em>, they are not workable) when applied to financial end-users that are now coming within the scope of their mandates.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>I am very appreciative of the many people whose efforts have contributed to bringing these rulemakings to fruition.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>First, the members of the GMAC, and especially the GMAC Margin Subcommittee, who devoted a tremendous amount of time to provide us with a high-quality report on complex margin issues during the turmoil of the start of the pandemic.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Second, Chairman Tarbert and my fellow Commissioners for working with me on these important issues.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>And finally, the Staff of the Market Participants Division, whose tireless efforts have enabled us to advance these initiatives to assure that our uncleared margin rules are workable for all and are in line with international standards, thereby enhancing compliance consistent with our oversight responsibilities under the CEA.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"></div>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"

The second report makes recommendations for improving derivatives clearing organizations\u2019 (DCOs) governance arrangements through further enhancements to the effectiveness of CFTC governance standards by ensuring that DCOs\u2019 management and their boards of directors have a formalized process to solicit, consider, and address input from varied clearing members and end-users before making decisions that could materially affect the risk profile of the DCO\u2019s activity.\u00a0 I am looking forward to receiving these final reports and fully appreciate these tremendous efforts.\u00a0 To that end, I wish to highlight that the CCP Risk subcommittee is continuing its work on additional work streams addressing stress testing and liquidity, transparency, capital and skin-in-the-game, and default management.\u00a0 These are all tremendously difficult issues, core issues that strike at the heart of market risk. \u00a0And consequently, they require careful deliberation, discussion, and ultimately time.\u00a0 It is my expectation that as the Subcommittee reaches conclusions and consensus on these issues, they will report back to the full MRAC in future meetings.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:16px;

style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Overview <p></p></span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>I am pleased to support the two final rulemakings that the Commission is adopting with respect to margin requirements for uncleared swaps.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>These rulemakings address several recommendations that the Commission received from its Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC), which I am proud to sponsor, and are based on a comprehensive report prepared by GMAC\u2019s Subcommittee on Margin Requirements for Non-Cleared Swaps (GMAC Margin Subcommittee).<a name=\"_ftnref1\" id=\"_ftnref1\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn1\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:\n_ftnref1\">[1]</span></a><span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>They demonstrate the value added to the Commission\u2019s policymaking by its Advisory Committees, in which market participants and other interested parties come together to provide us with their perspectives and potential solutions to practical problems. <p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>The two rulemakings we are adopting make 4 changes to the Commission\u2019s uncleared margin rules.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>The four changes have much to commend them \u2013 indeed, we did not receive any comment letters opposing them.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>These rule changes further objectives that I have commented on before:</span></p>\n\n<ul><li class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>the need to tailor our rules to assure that they are workable for those required to comply with them;</span></li>\n\t<li class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"text-indent: -0.25in; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">the benefits of codifying relief that has been issued by our Staff and re-visiting our rules, where appropriate; and</span></li>\n\t<li class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>the imperative of harmonizing our margin requirements with those of our international colleagues in order to facilitate compliance and coordinated regulatory oversight.\u00a0<p></p></span></li>\n</ul><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>A Different Universe is Coming into Scope of the Uncleared Margin Rules<p></p></span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>The Commission\u2019s uncleared margin rules for swap dealers, like the Framework of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Board of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (BCBS/IOSCO) on which they are based,<a name=\"_ftnref2\" id=\"_ftnref2\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn2\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref2\">[2]</span></a> were designed primarily to ensure the exchange of margin between the largest, most systemic, and interconnected financial institutions for their uncleared swap transactions with one another.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Today, these institutions and transactions are subject to uncleared margin requirements that have taken effect since the rules were adopted.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Pursuant to the phased implementation schedule of the Commission\u2019s rules and the BCBS/IOSCO Framework, though, a different universe of market participants \u2013 presenting unique considerations \u2013 will soon be coming into scope of the margin rules.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>It is only now, as we enter the final phases of the implementation schedule, that the Commission\u2019s uncleared margin rules will apply to a significant number of financial end-users, and we have a responsibility to make sure they are fit for that purpose.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Accordingly, now is the time we must thoughtfully consider whether the regulatory parameters that we have designed for the largest financial institutions in the earlier phases of margin implementation need to be tailored to account for the practical and operational challenges posed by the exchange of margin when one of the counterparties is a pension plan, endowment, insurance provider, mortgage service provider, or other financial end-user.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>The rulemaking regarding the \u201cminimum transfer amount\u201d does exactly that.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>The Commission\u2019s uncleared margin rules provide that a swap dealer is not required to collect or post initial margin (IM) or variation margin (VM) with a counterparty until the combined amount of such IM and VM exceeds the minimum transfer amount (MTA) of $500,000.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Yet, the application of the MTA presents a significant operational challenge for institutional investors that typically hire asset managers to exercise investment discretion over portions of their assets in separately managed accounts (SMAs) for purposes of diversification.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>As a practical matter, neither the owner of the SMA, the manager of the assets in the SMA, nor the swap dealer that is a counterparty to the SMA is in a position to readily determine when the MTA has been exceeded on an aggregate basis (or to assure that it is not).<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span><p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>To address this challenge, the Commission is amending the definition of MTA in its margin rules to allow a swap dealer to apply an MTA of up to $50,000 to each SMA owned by a counterparty with which the swap dealer enters into uncleared swaps.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>As noted in the release, any potential increase in uncollateralized credit risk as a result would be mitigated both by the conditions set out in the rules we are adopting, as well as existing safeguards in the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and the Commission\u2019s regulations.<a name=\"_ftnref3\" id=\"_ftnref3\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn3\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:\n_ftnref3\">[3]</span></a><p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>This is a sensible approach and an appropriate refinement to make the Commission\u2019s uncleared margin rules workable for SMAs given the realities of the modern investment management environment.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>As I have stated before, no matter how well-intentioned a rule may be, if it is not workable, it cannot deliver on its intended purpose.<a name=\"_ftnref4\" id=\"_ftnref4\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn4\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref4\">[4]</span></a><span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span><p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>The Benefits of Codifying Staff Relief and Re-Visiting our Rules <p></p></span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Application of MTA to SMAs</span></i></b><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>:<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>The rule change that I have discussed above regarding the application of the MTA to SMAs would codify no-action relief in Letter No. 17-12 that our Staff issued in 2017.<a name=\"_ftnref5\" id=\"_ftnref5\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn5\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref5\">[5]</span></a><span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>The Commission\u2019s Staff often has occasion to issue relief or take other action in the form of no-action letters, interpretative letters, or advisories on various issues and in various circumstances.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>This affords the Commission a chance to observe how the Staff action operates in real-time, and to evaluate lessons learned.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>With the benefit of this time and experience, the Commission should then consider whether codifying such Staff action into rules is appropriate.<a name=\"_ftnref6\" id=\"_ftnref6\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn6\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref6\">[6]</span></a><span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span><p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>As I have said before, \u201c[i]t is simply good government to re-visit our rules and assess whether certain rules need to be updated, evaluate whether rules are achieving their objectives, and identify rules that are falling short and should be withdrawn or improved.\u201d<a name=\"_ftnref7\" id=\"_ftnref7\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn7\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref7\">[7]</span></a><span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Experience with the Staff no-action relief in Letter No. 17-12 supports our rule change to tailor the application of the MTA under the Commission\u2019s uncleared margin rules in the SMA context.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span><p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Two of the other rule changes that we are adopting similarly would codify existing Staff no-action relief in recognition of market realities:<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Separate MTAs for IM and VM</span></i></b><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>:<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Our second rule change regarding the MTA, consistent with Staff no-action Letter No. 19-25,<a name=\"_ftnref8\" id=\"_ftnref8\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn8\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref8\">[8]</span></a> would recognize that a swap dealer may apply separate MTAs for IM and VM with each counterparty, provided that the MTAs corresponding to IM and VM are specified in the margin documentation required under the Commission\u2019s regulations, and that the MTAs, on a combined basis, do not exceed the prescribed MTA.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span><p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Staff\u2019s no-action relief, and the Commission\u2019s rule amendments to codify that relief, take into account the separate settlement workflows that swap counterparties maintain to reflect, from an operational perspective, the different regulatory treatment of IM and VM.<a name=\"_ftnref9\" id=\"_ftnref9\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn9\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref9\">[9]</span></a><span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>And given that the total amount of combined IM and VM exchanged would not exceed the prescribed MTA, separate MTAs for IM and VM would not materially increase the amount of credit risk at a given time.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Under Letter No. 19-25 and this codification, swap dealers and their counterparties can manage MTA in an operationally practicable way that aligns with the market standard.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span><p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Reliance on Counterparty\u2019s Model Calculation of IM</span></i></b><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>:<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>A third rule change we are adopting codifies a Staff no-action position taken in Letter No. 19-29,<a name=\"_ftnref10\" id=\"_ftnref10\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn10\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref10\">[10]</span></a> providing that a swap dealer may use the risk-based model calculation of IM of a counterparty that is a CFTC-registered swap dealer as the amount of IM that the former must collect from the latter.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>The release states the Commission\u2019s expectation that this alternative method of IM collection will be used by swap dealers with a discrete and limited swap business consisting primarily of entering into uncleared customer-facing swaps with end-user counterparties, and then hedging the risk of those swaps with uncleared swaps entered into with a few other swap dealers.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span><p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Simply put, not all swap dealers are created equal.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>It is therefore appropriate to tailor our uncleared margin regime accordingly.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Letter No. 19-29 recognized this reality and smoothed the rough edges of our otherwise one-size-fits-all uncleared margin rules, and it is appropriate to codify that result.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Yet, under the rule amendments being adopted, this alternative method is subject to the condition that the uncleared swaps for which a swap dealer uses the risk-based model calculation of IM of its swap dealer counterparty are entered into for the purpose of hedging the former\u2019s own risk from entering into customer-facing swaps with non-swap dealer counterparties.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>This is a departure from the GMAC Margin Subcommittee, which did not recommend such a condition.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>I am concerned by comments we received suggesting that this condition may cause this rule change to prove unworkable in practice.<a name=\"_ftnref11\" id=\"_ftnref11\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn11\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref11\">[11]</span></a><span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>I am encouraged that the rulemaking release addresses some of these comments by, among other things, confirming: 1) the flexibility of swap dealers as part of their hedging strategy to match a set of customer-facing swaps with one or more hedging swaps undertaken with other swap dealer counterparties; and 2) that customer-facing swaps entered into through anticipatory hedging or that are subsequently terminated would be deemed hedges for purposes of the alternative method of IM calculation.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Nevertheless, if over time, market participants find that the hedging condition causes this rule change to fail to fulfill its intended purpose, I urge them to alert the Commission so that it can consider appropriate adjustments.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>International Harmonization to Enhance Compliance and Coordinated Regulation<p></p></span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>The Commission\u2019s fourth and final rule change would revise the calculation method for determining whether financial end-users come within the scope of the IM requirements, and the timing for compliance with the IM requirements after the end of the compliance schedule.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>These changes would align certain timing and calculation issues under the Commission\u2019s margin rules with both the BCBS/IOSCO Framework and the manner in which these issues are handled by our regulatory colleagues in all other major market jurisdictions.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Swap dealers must exchange IM with respect to uncleared swaps that they enter into with a financial end-user counterparty that has \u201cmaterial swaps exposure\u201d (MSE).<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>The Commission\u2019s margin rules currently provide that after the last phase of compliance, MSE is to be determined on <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">January 1</i>, and that an entity has MSE if it has more than $8 billion in average aggregate notional amount (AANA) during <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">June, July, and August </i>of<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\"> the prior year</i>.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>By contrast, under the BCBS/IOSCO Framework and in virtually every other country in the world, an entity is determined to come into scope of the IM requirement on <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">September 1</i>, and an entity has MSE if it has the equivalent of $8 billion in AANA<a name=\"_ftnref12\" id=\"_ftnref12\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn12\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref12\">[12]</span></a> during <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">March, April,</i> and <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">May</i> of <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal\">that year</i>.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>The reason the United States is out-of-step with the rest of the world on these timing and calculation issues is not because of any reasoned policy determination.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Rather, it is the result of a quirk that the U.S. margin rules were adopted based on the BCBS/IOSCO Framework that was in effect at the time \u2013 but the BCBS/IOSCO Framework was revised two years later.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>In a further disconnect, the Commission\u2019s margin rules look to the <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal\">daily average AANA</i> during the three-month calculation period for determining MSE, whereas the BCBS/IOSCO Framework and other major market jurisdictions base the AANA calculation on an <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal\">average of month-end dates </i>during that period.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Yet, as noted in the rulemaking release, the Commission\u2019s Office of the Chief Economist has estimated that calculations based on end-of-month AANA generally would yield similar results as calculations based on the Commission\u2019s current daily AANA approach.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>It has been suggested that this rule change theoretically might incentivize a firm to \u201cwindow dress\u201d its swap exposures as the month-end approaches in order to avoid margin requirements.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>But the GMAC Margin Subcommittee observed that it would be neither practicable nor financially desirable for parties to tear-up their positions on a recurring basis prior to the month-end calculation,<a name=\"_ftnref13\" id=\"_ftnref13\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn13\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:\n_ftnref13\">[13]</span></a> because doing so would interfere with hedging strategies and cause the firm to incur realized profit and loss.<a name=\"_ftnref14\" id=\"_ftnref14\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn14\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref14\">[14]</span></a><p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Accordingly, the Commission is amending these timing and calculation provisions of its uncleared margin rules to harmonize them with the BCBS/IOSCO Framework and the approach followed by our international colleagues.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Given the global nature of the derivatives markets, we should always seek international harmonization of our regulations unless a compelling reason exists not to do so \u2013 which is not the case here.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Indeed, in the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress specifically directed the Commission, \u201c[i]n order to promote effective and consistent global regulation of swaps,\u201d to \u201cconsult and coordinate with foreign regulatory authorities on the establishment of consistent international standards with respect to the regulation . . . of swaps [and] swap entities . . .\u201d<a name=\"_ftnref15\" id=\"_ftnref15\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn15\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref15\">[15]</span></a>\u00a0 And when the G-20 leaders met in Pittsburgh in the midst of the financial crisis in 2009, they, too, recognized that a workable solution for global derivatives markets demands coordinated policies and cooperation.<a name=\"_ftnref16\" id=\"_ftnref16\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn16\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark:_ftnref16\">[16]</span></a><p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Our rule change regarding MSE is true to the direction of Congress in the Dodd-Frank Act, and honors the commitment of the G-20 leaders at the Pittsburgh summit.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Differences between countries in the detailed timing and calculation requirements with respect to uncleared margin compel participants in these global markets to run multiple compliance calculations \u2013 for no particular regulatory reason.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>This not only forces market participants to bear unnecessary costs, but actually hinders compliance with margin requirements because of the entirely foreseeable prospect of calculation errors in applying the different rules.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>As noted above, now is the time to address this disconnect in MSE timing and calculation requirements because the financial end-users to which the MSE definition applies are coming into scope of the margin rules.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>During the unfortunate events of the financial crisis, we learned that coordination among global regulators, working towards a common objective, is essential.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>That lesson remains true today, and we are reminded that disregarding this reality has the potential to weaken, rather than strengthen, the effectiveness of our oversight and the resilience of global derivatives markets.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>There Remains Unfinished Business <p></p></span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>While I am pleased with the steps the Commission is taking, there remains unfinished business in the implementation of uncleared margin requirements.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>As an initial matter, U.S. prudential regulators with oversight authority over bank swap dealers have not yet adopted the corresponding rule changes relevant for consistent applications.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>As a result, although commenters expressed support for the Commission proceeding with these rule changes even in the absence of parallel action by the U.S. prudential regulators, the operational difficulties confronting market participants that are coming into scope of the margin rules will not be fully addressed when they enter into uncleared swaps with bank swap dealers.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>I look forward to continuing the dialogue with our regulatory colleagues at other U.S. agencies to support addressing these challenges.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>In addition, the report of the GMAC Margin Subcommittee recommended several actions, beyond those that we are adopting, to address the hurdles associated with the application of uncleared margin requirements to end-users.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Having been present for the development of the Dodd-Frank Act, I recall that the concerns expressed by many lawmakers at the time focused on the application of the new requirements to end-users.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>The unique challenges with respect to uncleared margin that caused uneasiness back in 2009-2010 are now much more immediate as the margin requirements are being phased in to apply to these end-users.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>As the calendar turns into the new year, I look forward to continuing to work together to address the other recommendations contained in the GMAC Margin Subcommittee\u2019s report regarding applying the uncleared margin rules to financial end-users.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>The need to do so will only become more urgent as time marches on.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>Conclusion <p></p></span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>To be clear, these four changes to the uncleared margin rules are not a \u201croll-back\u201d of the margin requirements that apply today to the largest financial institutions in their swap transactions with one another.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Rather, they reflect a thoughtful refinement of our rules to align them with the rest of the international regulatory community, and to take account of specific circumstances in which the rules impose substantial practical and operational challenges (<em>i.e.</em>, they are not workable) when applied to financial end-users that are now coming within the scope of their mandates.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'>I am very appreciative of the many people whose efforts have contributed to bringing these rulemakings to fruition.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>First, the members of the GMAC, and especially the GMAC Margin Subcommittee, who devoted a tremendous amount of time to provide us with a high-quality report on complex margin issues during the turmoil of the start of the pandemic.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>Second, Chairman Tarbert and my fellow Commissioners for working with me on these important issues.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>And finally, the Staff of the Market Participants Division, whose tireless efforts have enabled us to advance these initiatives to assure that our uncleared margin rules are workable for all and are in line with international standards, thereby enhancing compliance consistent with our oversight responsibilities under the CEA.<p></p></span></p>\n\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"></div>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"

Leading the men and women of the CFTC these last 17 months has been an extraordinary privilege but, like all good things, it must come to an end. Today, I am announcing that I intend to resign my position as Chairman early next year.</p><p></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I am immensely proud of the agency\u2019s accomplishments in our pursuit to be the global standard for sound derivatives regulation. During my tenure, we have held 20 open meetings, more than the previous 7 years combined; we have vigorously protected the integrity of our markets and set numerous enforcement records; we have successfully concluded negotiations with the EU and UK to build stronger relationships with our regulatory counterparts overseas; we have promoted responsible fintech innovation and declared Ether a commodity; we have seen more than 1,000 new products self-certified to trade on our markets; we have taken strides to deliver more value for taxpayers and be an even better place for our employees to work; we have enhanced our agency\u2019s diversity, with more women and people of color serving in senior leadership roles than ever before; and so much more. We have done all of this with the interests of everyday Americans in mind\u2014including our nation\u2019s farmers and ranchers who rely on derivatives to hedge their risk. With the agenda I laid out last year now complete, the Commission can fully turn its focus to the unwritten future. </p><p></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A majority of our work has taken place in the midst of COVID-19\u2014a global pandemic that is testing the strength of our markets and our ability to adapt. Amid historic volatility, the CFTC has provided a steady hand and watchful eye while our markets act as shock absorbers. There is no doubt in my mind this has been the CFTC\u2019s \u201cfinest hour\u201d during our celebrated 45-year history.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p><p></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Of course, none of these achievements would have been possible without the hard work of the CFTC\u2019s dedicated career public servants, our Executive Leadership Team, and my personal staff within the Office of the Chairman.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>I also owe a deep debt of gratitude to my fellow Commissioners, who I am proud to call not just colleagues, but also friends. Together we have advanced 40 final rules and 21 proposals\u2014nearly 90 percent of them on a bipartisan basis. The partisan divisions in Washington may run deep, but the Commission\u2019s historically collegial atmosphere has continued uninterrupted.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span></p><p></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I am truly grateful to our President and his Administration for their confidence and the opportunity to serve.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">\u00a0 </span>I am also humbled by the broad, bipartisan support of my leadership and agenda across both houses of Congress during my tenure. Finally, I am most deeply appreciative for my wife and two young boys, who have supported me\u2014and my long hours\u2014every step of the way.</p><p></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;\nline-height:107%;font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif'><p></p></span></p>\n</div>\n      \n          <p align=\"center\"><b>-CFTC-</b></p><p>\n      </p></div>\n\n</article>"},

Capital Policy at CME Group and Dmitri Senko, Chief Risk Officer at Eurex Clearing, will present on their respective CCPs\u2019 experiences during the pandemic.\u00a0 Lastly, Sayee Srinivasan, Deputy Director in the Division of Clearing and Risk at the CFTC, will present a regulator\u2019s perspective on CCP margin practices during the market volatility.\u00a0 I am hopeful that these presentations will contribute to the ongoing dialogue regarding lessons learned from the market volatility earlier this year so that the global clearing system can remain resilient in the face of future market stresses.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:16px;
